# Leadership

Leadership dimension groups work satisfaction factors related to employees satisfaction from being led by good leaders.



## Communication
Being led by leaders who listen to employees' concerns or views, communicate effectively and are ready to offer feedback.


### Dysfunctional communication
Leaders are perceived as not communicating enough or not effectively. Employees may feel like they are in the dark about what is going on and how their work fits into the bigger picture. Business units may not be able to collaborate effectively due to lack of knowledge sharing.

* *the communication is not working*

* *no timely dissemination of information to employees*

* *strategy is not clearly communicated*

* *lack of communication between teams*




### Inefficient meetings

* *meetings fatigue*

* *time wasted in meetings*

* *too many meetings*

* *meetings about meetings*

### Poor performance feedback
Performance feedback is either not provided by leaders or only sporadically. There might be also a feeling that the performance evaluations are not based on individual performance, but more so on group dynamics and personality issues instead. Feedback culture in general is seen to be lacking, with employees having little access to real time assessment of their performance.

* *no clear or actionable feedback*

## Decision-making
Being led by leaders who make quick decisions taking into account employees' views.


### Employees input ignored
Employees are not listened to or their suggestions are not implemented. Leadership decides unilaterally without consulting employees or it pretends to listen to employees but fails to take onboard their comments. Leadership might also create atmosphere in which open discussion of difficult topics is not welcomed.

__Exemplary statements reported by employees:__

* *top-down management style*

* *no bottom up communication*

* *employees not involved in decision process*

* *employees have low impact on matters important to them*

### Slow decision-making
Leaders are perceived as being slow in making decisions. It might be that the whole organization or specific departments have long approval processes or many managers are involved in taking a single decision. Sometimes leaders intentionally avoid taking decisions because they are punished for mistakes but not rewarded for successes.

## Empowerment
Being led by leaders who encourage employees to take responsibility for the decisions at work and to trust employees to make their own decisions.


### Limited work autonomy

Their lack of care and compassion is felt by employees and has a negative impact on employees' well-being.
