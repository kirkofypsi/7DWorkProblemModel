# Leadership

Leadership dimension groups work satisfaction factors related to employees satisfaction from being led by good leaders.



## Communication
Being led by leaders who listen to employees' concerns or views, communicate effectively and are ready to offer feedback.


### Dysfunctional communication
Leaders are perceived as not communicating enough or not effectively. Employees may feel like they are in the dark about what is going on and how their work fits into the bigger picture. Business units may not be able to collaborate effectively due to lack of knowledge sharing.


### Inefficient meetings
Leaders run business meetings in a way that is perceived  a time waste. There are too many meetings, they lack focus, have no specific purpose or their outcome is not clear.


### Poor performance feedback
Performance feedback is either not provided by leaders or only sporadically. There might be also a feeling that the performance evaluations are not based on individual performance, but more so on group dynamics and personality issues instead. Feedback culture in general is seen to be lacking, with employees having little access to real time assessment of their performance.



## Decision-making
Being led by leaders who make quick decisions taking into account employees' views.


### Employees input ignored
Employees are not listened to or their suggestions are not implemented. Leadership decides unilaterally without consulting employees or it pretends to listen to employees but fails to take onboard their comments. Leadership might also create atmosphere in which open discussion of difficult topics is not welcomed.


### Slow decision-making
Leaders are perceived as being slow in making decisions. It might be that the whole organization or specific departments have long approval processes or many managers are involved in taking a single decision. Sometimes leaders intentionally avoid taking decisions because they are punished for mistakes but not rewarded for successes.



## Empowerment
Being led by leaders who encourage employees to take responsibility for the decisions at work and to trust employees to make their own decisions.


### Limited work autonomy
Leaders do not delegate authority or empower employees. They micromanage and constantly scrutinize the work of their staff. Employees are not given enough freedom to work how they want or make decisions on their own.



## Fairness
Being led by leaders who treat employees fairly by applying the same criteria to every employee.


### Unmerited promotions
Leaders are perceived as not being fair in awarding promotions. Employees have a perception that promotions are too often given to poorly performing employees, unqualified internal candidates or people who are using personal connections to get promoted. The overall feeling is that promotions are decided arbitrarily, wrongfully and sometimes dishonestly.


### Other unfair decisions
Leaders are perceived as being unfair in other aspects than promotion-related. They might not be meritocratic, might apply unfair practices toward employees, or treat preferentially some employees. The organization may not have a fair system in place for rewards, appraisals, hiring, work assignment or other decisions.



## Integrity
Being led by leaders who act consistently on the basis of a set of values and principles they believe in.


### Lying or deceitful leaders
Leaders are perceived as lying or deceitful. They are either manipulative or they lie directly to employees' faces. They might be making empty promises, not keeping their word and thus deceiving people.



## Competence
Being led by leaders who have the necessary knowledge and skills to carry out their job.


### Incompetent leaders
Leaders are not equipped with the necessary skills to fulfill their management duties. To employees, they are either incompetent or unprofessional. They cannot be considered role models for their subordinates and peers.



## Respectfulness
Being led by leaders who treat all employees with dignity and show appreciation for their efforts at work.


### No appreciation or recognition
Leaders are perceived as showing little or no appreciation for hard work and contributions made by employees. They are accused of undervaluing their employees, minimizing individual contributions made 
by them or simply not recognizing any great work done, which could diminish employees' sense of accomplishment and motivation.


### Egocentric or aggressive leaders
Leaders are perceived as being egocentric or aggressive. They are disrespectful to employees and lack appropriate manners which manifests itself by the very aggressive communication style or use of a rude language. Finally, some of the leaders demonstrate conceiting attitude or behavior.



## Supportiveness
Being led by leaders who are accessible, supportive and show interest in employees' personal success.


### Absent or disconnected leaders
Leaders are perceived as either absent or disconnected. "Delegate and disappear" is their usual leadership style. They are either hard to reach, not available or unapproachable. Some might be living in their own world and their help is useless as they have no understanding of what the real needs of their workforce are.


### Uncaring leaders
Leaders are perceived as unsupportive of employees, not caring about them and not giving any guidance or support to help staff succeed in their jobs. Sometimes leaders may pretend to care about people, but in practice they act as they do not. Their lack of care and compassion is felt by employees and has a negative impact on employees' well-being.
