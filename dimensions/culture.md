# Culture

"Culture" dimension refers to employees satisfaction from having a great culture in the organization. Its factors are related to the ability to work in an environment where it is easy to feel comfortable and to be a part of the organization's identity.

## Cooperativeness

Working for an organization that encourages teamwork and collaboration across employees.	

### Conflicted or siloed organization

As a consequence different parts of the organization are not cooperating and they work against each other. Siloes lead to operational inefficiencies, poor information sharing and lack of synergy in the organization.

### Unhealthy employees competition
