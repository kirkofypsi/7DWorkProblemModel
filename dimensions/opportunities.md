Opportunities dimension groups work satisfaction factors related to employees satisfaction from having good opportunities for professional, intellectual and social development.

## CAREER GROWTH
Having enough opportunities for switching roles, higher level of responsibility and career growth.

### DIFFICULTIES IN INTERNAL TRANSFERS

__Exemplary statements reported by employees:__

* *no rotation for jobs*
* *hard to move around the organisation*
* *limited opportunities to move overseas*
* *hard to transit to another department*
* *no lateral movement*

### OUTSIDERS FAVORED OVER INSIDERS

__Exemplary statements reported by employees:__

* *company loves to hire outside*
* *company tends to not promote from within*
* *always go outside the organization to hire*
* *hire outside attitude*
* *all new key roles are for externals*

### POOR CAREER GROWTH
> Organization does not offer enough opportunities for career growth. Employees might find it difficult to move up in the organization either because positions are rarely vacant or because the promotion process is lengthy and complex or due to the fact that the organization is not growing and, thus, new positions are not added.

__Exemplary statements reported by employees:__

* *no focus on career building*
* *almost impossible to make a career here*
* *career stagnation*
* *no room for career growth*
* *hard to break into highier ranks*

## IMPACT
Having enough opportunities for making an impact on the organization by using one's skills and abilities.

### UNIMPACTFUL WORK

## LEARNING
Having enough opportunities to learn new things in an achievable and non-overwhelming manner.

__Exemplary statements reported by employees:__

* *constant learning*
* *information overload*
* *steep learning curve*
* *a lot of information to absorb*
* *have to learn new things at fast pace*

### TOO LITTLE LEARNING

### LIMITED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS

## WORK NATURE
Having enough opportunities for being involved in creative, challenging tasks in a way that does not endanger mental or physical health.

### DIFFICULT CUSTOMERS
> Employees have to deal with difficult customers. The organization might not have the necessary tools or procedures in place to deal with customers that are aggressive or abusive. It may also lack a proper customer service training program which would enable employees to handle toxic customers more effectively.

* *getting yelled at by customers*
* *stressful situations with customers*
* *hostile client base*

* *severe multitasking with high distraction levels*
* *mutitasking*
* *constant context switching*
* *multiple assignments*

* *you will be pushed out of your comfort zone*

* *long hours standing*
* *long hours on your feet*
* *hard labour*

### TEDIOUS OR UNINTERESTING WORK

* *monotony in tasks*
* *doing the same tasks each quarter*
