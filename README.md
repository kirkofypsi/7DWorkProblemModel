__The Institute for a Better Workplace__ conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on how organizations are impacted by work problems. The study was based on more than two million opinions provided by employees from over 300 organizations on their workplace experiences. Machine learning and natural language processing were used to process that vast amount of data and extract 3-level taxonomy of workproblems based on real employees accounts. The resulting classification system called the 7D Work Problem Modelâ„¢ defines seven work satisfaction dimensions that are further decomposed into work satisfaction factors. Work problems that constitute the lowest level of classification are assigned to the satisfaction factors they most negatively affect.
