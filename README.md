# Introduction

In the 21st century, work is still a miserable experience despite all the technological advances. Numerous reports show that most of today's workforce is disengaged and that this disengagement has worsened over the last few decades. As job satisfaction is strongly correlated with mental health, dissatisfaction from work may partially explain the recent raise of psychological issues among working adults. __The Institute for a Better Workplace__ believes that we must take this issue seriously because it has severe implications for the economy and society and that we cannot afford to maintain such a dysfunctional work system in the long term.

We believe that low satisfaction from work largely stems from the fact that modern companies are extremely non-transparent and are able to successfully employ propaganda to create a favorable but untrue image of themselves. This in turn prevents the general public from realizing weaknesses of organizations and creates an opportunity for companies to continue their current bad practices. Our aim is to open the black box of companies and to provide a neutral point of view on the working world. In order to do that, however, we had to first create an exhaustive catalogue of the most common work problems. Without it, it would be extremely difficult to objectively compare different companies by their work climate and to offer to the general public a uniform, digestible, and easy-to-understand view of what is happening at different work places. 

# Catalogue of work problems

Work-related health risks have been since long studied by the science.  Initially, those studies were almost completely limited to physical work hazards but in the recent decades, the focus has shifted towards mental and social factors and how they affect workers' health.  In scientific literature, they are usually referred to as psychosocial stressors or hazards. We use instead the simpler term __work problem__ as we want to also cover those work characteristics that prevents employees from achieving self actualization and full satisfaction from work, even if they are not negatively affecting employees' mental health. Therefore for us the term __work problem__ means any source of employees' frustration, stress, or dissatisfaction in the workplace.

Unfortunately, there is an absence in the scientific literature of a reference taxonomy cataloguing all factors leading to dissatisfaction in the workplace, even if we limit ourselves only to psychosocial stressors and physical hazards. Numerous attempts were made, most notably the one described in [1] comprising of 53 categories, however, in our opinion they are not covering all relevant dissatisfaction factors and were not derived from analysis of really large datasets of employees opinions (1M+).

# 7D Work Problem Model™

In order to build taxonomy of work problems that is exhaustive and whose validity is tested on large numbers of employees opinions the __Institute for a Better Workplace__ conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on how organizations and employees are impacted by work problems. The study was based on more than two million opinions about workplace experiences gathered from the employees of over 300 organizations. Two million opinions is equivalent to 250 average-sized books so obviously without the advances in machine learning and the recent transformers revolution in NLP such a study would have been very difficult to conduct.

The resulting classification system called the __7D Work Problem Model™__ assigns each __work problem__ to the __work satisfaction factor__ that is most negatively affected by this problem occurence in the organization. Work satisfaction factors are subsequently grouped into __work satisfaction dimensions__ representing crucial concepts from the areas of management and systems organization.

*Summary of 7D Work Problem Model™ taxonomy levels*

| Level (from the top)  |      Level name      |  Description  | Cardinality |
|-----------------------|---------------------:|--------------:|------------:| 
|  1|  __Work satisfaction dimension__ |  high-level components of work satisfaction in the organization representing crucial concepts from the areas of management and systems organization | 7 |
|  2|  __Work satisfaction factor__   | low-level components of work satisfaction in the organization; work problems negatively affect work satisfaction factors | 39  |
|  3| __Work problem__ | any source of frustration, stress, or dissatisfaction for the employees in their workplace | 130 |

* __Opportunities__  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <-- *Work satisfaction dimension*
    * __Career growth__  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <-- *Work satisfaction factor*
       * Poor career growth  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <-- *Work problem*
       * Difficulties in internal transfers  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <-- *Work problem*
       * Undefined career paths  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <-- *Work problem*
       * Outsiders favored over insiders  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <-- *Work problem*

__The Institute for a Better Workplace__ decided to open-source work problem taxonomy in order to make it available to researchers and companies interested in the topic. It is our hope that this taxonomy will be used to improve work environments and the health of employees around the world.
