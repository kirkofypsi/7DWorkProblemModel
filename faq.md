## What is Culturama?
Culturama is a first-of-its-kind work culture analytics system, covering 1,500 major companies and drawing insights from 5 million employee opinions. It utilizes GPT technology, popularized by ChatGPT, to analyze public employee comments about companies.

Unlike one-time paper studies, Culturama is a continuous study with quarterly updates, ensuring the information always stays relevant.

What truly sets Culturama apart from traditional work culture studies is its approach to discussing work cultures. While many rely on abstract concepts like "Agility," "Performance," or "Execution" to describe work environments, Culturama focuses on 130 common workplace problems that employees and employers can easily understand. These issues include the "Blame game," "Tight deadlines," "Late or incorrect pay," and "Uncaring managers." This practical approach enables users to draw meaningful conclusions and take action to address these challenges in the workplace.
