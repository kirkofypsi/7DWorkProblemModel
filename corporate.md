## Corporate Culturama

Corporate Culturama shares many similarities with the web interface of public Culturama (https://culturama.is), but it is a separate service designed specifically for individual companies.

## Deployment

Each Corporate Culturama deployment is a unique instance created exclusively for a single company, with access limited to personnel selected by the client. It also has a different URL than public Culturama: <<company_name>>.corporate.culturama.io.

## Data Sources 

Data in Corporate Culturama is gathered from at least one of the following sources:

 - __Internal Survey Data__ - data provided by the customer, originating from various internal sources such as exit interviews and open-ended questions from employee feedback surveys like GPTW surveys. At a minimum, the data should contain a list of opinions with each opinion's reporting date. Additional information like employee demographics (age, sex) or hierarchical data (position, department, function, geography) can also be uploaded.

 - __Internal Live Employee Data__ - data submitted directly by the customer's employees using our live reporting system. Employees authorized by their employer can add new opinions or update previous opinions on crucial workplace issues at any time.

 - __Additional Public Data__ - supplementary information on workplace cultures that is not readily available in the public Culturama database but is requested by the client. For instance, if a client's competitors are not among the 1,500 companies featured in public Culturama, we can make an effort to gather all publicly accessible data on those competitors. Similarly, if a customer's company is not among the 1,500 companies in public Culturama, we can scan and analyze the available information about them, allowing the client to gain a deeper understanding of their company's online public image

In addition to the above Corporate Culturama always contains: 

- __Culturama Public Data__ - information on 1,500 workplace cultures of the largest companies collected from all publicly accessible online sources, such as social media platforms, blogs, forums, and review websites.

## Scope of analysis

Like public Culturama, Corporate Culturama aims to detect various types of workplace problems through crowdsourcing. However, with the additional data collected, the analysis can be much more granular. Instant monitoring of the most pressing issues per geography, location, function, or specific demographics can be offered.

## Applications

 - Monitor workplace issues in real time by geography, function, department, or specific demographics, without the drawbacks of survey fatigue, manual analysis of open-ended responses, interpretation bias, or costly language translation.

 - Track changes in the intensity of workplace issues in real time.

 - Evaluate the impact of company events, such as management or process changes, on employee satisfaction.

 - Benchmark your work culture against competitors and industry standards.

 - Leverage insights into your competitors' challenges to effectively persuade candidates to switch companies by addressing their specific concerns.

 - Gain a deeper understanding of your company's online public image, or employer branding.

## Key differentiators

Using both internal survey data and live employee data:

 - __Industry/competitors benchmarking__ - ability to compare an organization's work culture with its competitors and industry benchmarks, a feature not previously available due to the lack of industry and competitor data. Culturama provides a comprehensive view of work culture across various industries by covering a wide range of 1,500 major companies using 5 million employee opinions, 

 - __High precision__ - Culturama offers high granularity of workplace problem detection, as it identifies 130 common workplace issues that are practical and easily understandable for employers to address, rather than relying on high-level, abstract concepts or only detecting overall sentiment.

 - __Cost-efficient and consistent analysis__ - significantly reduces the cost and effort required for analyzing open-text employee feedback, while also ensuring consistency and eliminating interpretation bias introduced by different analysts.

Using live employee data:

- __Rapid and continuous monitoring__ - instead of relying on periodic surveys, the system can collect and analyze data continuously, providing real-time insights into employee concerns and sentiment. Decision-makers are immediately informed about patterns and trends in weak areas of every function/department/location, allowing for quick implementation of corrections and identifying correlations between business decisions and employee satisfaction.

- __Unprompted research__ - allows employees to articulate their concerns without bias or leading questions, resulting in more genuine and accurate feedback.

 - __Avoids survey fatigue__ - collects employee feedback on workplace issues in a natural and unprompted way, without burdening them with lengthy and repetitive surveys that can lead to disengagement and autopilot responses.

- __Anonymity and confidentiality__: ensures that employees can express their concerns without fear of retribution, thanks to the data being processed by a third party. Culturama only shows aggregated data, not individual feedback, maintaining the anonymity of employees and further encouraging honest and open communication.

## Technology

Culturama: 

 - leverages advanced NLP technology, akin to OpenAI's ChatGPT, to accurately identify detailed workplace problems, going beyond simple sentiment analysis in employee opinions.

 - achieves an impressive F1-score of 0.93 on a 100K-example dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of its fine-tuned classification model.

 - successfully identifies work-related issues in 94% of 5 million employee opinions, showcasing its ability to handle multiple languages and contexts.

## Sales channels

- __Partner Sales__: Leveraging partnerships with HR software providers, employee engagement consultants, and talent acquisition firms to distribute and sell corporate Culturama,
- __Direct Sales__: Selling corporate Culturama directly to customers through Culturama's own sales team or website.
