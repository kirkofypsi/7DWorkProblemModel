## Corporate Culturama

Corporate Culturama shares many similarities with the web interface of public Culturama (https://culturama.is), but it is a separate service designed specifically for individual companies.

## Deployment

Each Corporate Culturama deployment is a unique instance created exclusively for a single company, with access limited to personnel selected by the client. It also has a different URL than public Culturama: <<company_name>>.corporate.culturama.io.

## Data Sources 

Data in Corporate Culturama is gathered from up to five sources:

 - __Public Data__ - information on workplace cultures collected from all publicly accessible online sources, such as social media platforms, blogs, forums, and review websites. This includes all data from public Culturama on the 1,500 largest companies.

 - __Additional Public Data on Competitors__ - supplementary public information on workplace cultures that is not available in public Culturama but is requested by the customer. For example, if a client's competitors are not among the 1,500 companies featured in public Culturama, we can attempt to collect all publicly accessible data on those competitors.

 - __Additional Public Data on Customer__ - If a customer is not among the 1,500 companies featured in public Culturama, we can conduct a scan of all publicly available opinions on the customer upon request.

 - __Internal Survey Data__ - data provided by the customer, originating from various internal sources such as exit interviews and open-ended questions from employee feedback surveys like GPTW surveys. At a minimum, the data should contain a list of opinions with each opinion's reporting date. Additional information like employee demographics (age, sex) or hierarchical data (position, department, function, geography) can also be uploaded.

 - __Internal Live Employee Data__ - data submitted directly by the customer's employees using our live reporting system. Employees authorized by their employer can add new opinions or update previous opinions on crucial workplace issues at any time.

Of the above data sources, "Public Data" is always available, and at least one additional source is added according to the customer's preference.

## Scope of analysis

Like public Culturama, Corporate Culturama aims to detect various types of workplace problems through crowdsourcing. However, with the additional data collected, the analysis can be much more granular. Instant monitoring of the most pressing issues per geography, location, function, or specific demographics can be offered.

## Applications

 - Monitor workplace issues in real time by geography, function, department, or specific demographics, without the drawbacks of survey fatigue, manual analysis of open-ended responses, interpretation bias, or costly language translation.

 - Track changes in the intensity of workplace issues in real time.

 - Evaluate the impact of company events, such as management or process changes, on employee satisfaction.

 - Benchmark your work culture against competitors and industry standards.

 - Leverage insights into your competitors' challenges to effectively persuade candidates to switch companies by addressing their specific concerns.

 - Gain a deeper understanding of your company's online public image, or employer branding.

## Key differentiators

 - __Unprompted research__ - allows employees to articulate their concerns without bias or leading questions, resulting in more genuine and accurate feedback.

 - __Industry/competitors benchmarking__ - ability to compare an organization's work culture with its competitors and industry benchmarks, a feature not previously available due to the lack of industry and competitor data. Culturama provides a comprehensive view of work culture across various industries by covering a wide range of 1,500 major companies using 5 million employee opinions, 

 - __High precision__ - Culturama offers high granularity of workplace problem detection, as it identifies 130 common workplace issues that are practical and easily understandable for employers to address, rather than relying on high-level, abstract concepts or only detecting overall sentiment.

 - __Avoids survey fatigue__ - collects employee feedback in a natural and unprompted way, without burdening them with lengthy and repetitive surveys that can lead to disengagement and autopilot responses.

## Sales channels

- __Partner Sales__: Leveraging partnerships with HR software providers, employee engagement consultants, and talent acquisition firms to distribute and sell corporate Culturama,
- __Direct Sales__: Selling corporate Culturama directly to customers through Culturama's own sales team or website.
